# Mazo

Mazo is an autonomous financial research agent that thinks, plans, and learns as it works. It performs analysis using task planning, self-reflection, and real-time market data. Think Claude Code, but built specifically for financial research.


## Overview

Mazo takes complex financial questions and turns them into clear, step-by-step research plans. It runs those tasks using live market data, checks its own work, and refines the results until it has a confident, data-backed answer.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Intelligent Task Planning**: Automatically decomposes complex queries into structured research steps
- **Autonomous Execution**: Selects and executes the right tools to gather financial data
- **Self-Validation**: Checks its own work and iterates until tasks are complete
- **Real-Time Financial Data**: Access to income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements
- **Safety Features**: Built-in loop detection and step limits to prevent runaway execution

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.com) runtime (v1.0 or higher)
- OpenAI API key (get [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- Financial Datasets API key (get [here](https://financialdatasets.ai))
- Tavily API key (get [here](https://tavily.com)) - optional, for web search

#### Installing Bun

If you don't have Bun installed, you can install it using curl:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.com/install | bash
```

**Windows:**
```bash
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```

After installation, restart your terminal and verify Bun is installed:
```bash
bun --version
```

### Installing Mazo

1. Navigate to the mazo directory:
```bash
cd mazo
```

2. Install dependencies with Bun:
```bash
bun install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# The .env file is shared with the parent project
# Make sure these keys are set:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
# FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
# TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-api-key
```

### Usage

Run Mazo in interactive mode:
```bash
bun start
```

Or with watch mode for development:
```bash
bun dev
```

### Example Queries

Try asking Mazo questions like:
- "What was Apple's revenue growth over the last 4 quarters?"
- "Compare Microsoft and Google's operating margins for 2023"
- "Analyze Tesla's cash flow trends over the past year"
- "What is Amazon's debt-to-equity ratio based on recent financials?"

Mazo will automatically:
1. Break down your question into research tasks
2. Fetch the necessary financial data
3. Perform calculations and analysis
4. Provide a comprehensive, data-rich answer

## Architecture

Mazo uses a multi-agent architecture with specialized components:

- **Planning Agent**: Analyzes queries and creates structured task lists
- **Action Agent**: Selects appropriate tools and executes research steps
- **Validation Agent**: Verifies task completion and data sufficiency
- **Answer Agent**: Synthesizes findings into comprehensive responses

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- **UI Framework**: [React](https://react.dev) + [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) (terminal UI)
- **LLM Integration**: [LangChain.js](https://js.langchain.com) with multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- **Schema Validation**: [Zod](https://zod.dev)
- **Language**: TypeScript


### Changing Models

Type `/model` in the CLI to switch between:
- GPT 4.1 (OpenAI)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic)
- Gemini 3 (Google)

## Integration with AI Hedge Fund

Mazo is designed to work seamlessly with the AI Hedge Fund trading system:

- **Pre-Signal Research**: Gather context before AI Hedge Fund generates signals
- **Post-Signal Explanation**: Deep dive into why signals were generated
- **Agent-Specific Context**: Provide tailored research for each investor persona
